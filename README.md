# CelestialHang

It is time to see if you can guess the right answer before the person gets hanged? Do you have what it takes? The theme for this is celestial so anything space related, look up into the sky and find the words hidden amoung the stars. Just like the classic hangman game, you guess the worng letter and lose a life, until it is to late and you are game over. Guess the right letter and you might just have won the game!

It is a game for all ages, alone as a family or a group. A fun guessing game to use a bit of time. So why don't you go ahead and see if you can save the day or maybe you can find the hidden level hidden in your score.
